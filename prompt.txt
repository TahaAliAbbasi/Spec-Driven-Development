You are an expert AI Architect and Spec-Driven Development authority.

Your task is to generate a SINGLE, authoritative GLOBAL CONSTITUTION file for a unified AI-driven book project built using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code.

You MUST read and fully internalize the following PROJECT REQUIREMENTS, and then produce a constitution that governs ALL future specs, subagents, skills, code, content, and decisions.

====================
PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
====================

1. AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation:
- The book must be written using Docusaurus
- The book must be deployed to GitHub Pages
- All content creation must follow Spec-Kit Plus
- Claude Code is the primary AI author and engineer

2. Integrated RAG Chatbot:
- Embedded inside the published book
- Uses OpenAI Agents / ChatKit SDKs
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: Neon Serverless Postgres
- Vector DB: Qdrant Cloud Free Tier
- The chatbot must:
  - Answer questions ONLY from book content
  - Support answering questions based ONLY on user-selected text
  - Never hallucinate beyond available context

3. Scoring System:
- Base functionality: 100 points
- Bonus points awarded for:
  - Reusable intelligence via Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills (+50)
  - Signup & Signin using https://www.better-auth.com (+50)
  - Content personalization per chapter (+50)
  - Urdu translation per chapter (+50)

4. Authentication & Personalization:
- Signup asks about software and hardware background
- Personalization adapts chapter content to user background
- Personalization is triggered by a button at the start of each chapter
- Behavior differs for logged-in vs logged-out users

5. Translation:
- Logged-in users can translate chapter content to Urdu
- Translation must preserve technical accuracy
- Triggered by a button at the start of each chapter

====================
CONSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS
====================

The Global Constitution MUST include:

1. Core Principles
- Spec-Driven Development enforcement
- Zero hallucination policy
- Deterministic, explainable AI behavior

2. Agent Governance
- Definition of primary agents
- Rules for subagent creation
- Reusable intelligence and skills lifecycle
- Separation of concerns between content, RAG, frontend, backend

3. Content Rules
- Writing standards
- Progressive complexity
- Beginner-friendly explanations
- Consistency across chapters

4. RAG Rules
- Chunking strategy
- Embedding rules

- Selected-text-only answering enforcement
- Fallback responses when no context exists

5. Authentication & UX Rules
- Auth boundaries
- Personalization behavior
- Translation behavior
- Button-triggered transformations only
- No silent or automatic content mutation

6. Technical Enforcement
- Mandatory tech stack usage
- Forbidden shortcuts or violations
- Deployment guarantees

7. Extensibility & Evaluation
- How new features are added
- How bonus point features align with constitution
- How future phases must comply

====================
OUTPUT FORMAT
