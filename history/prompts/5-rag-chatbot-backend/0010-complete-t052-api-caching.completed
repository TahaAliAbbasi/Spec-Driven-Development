  Complete T052: Add API response caching for improved performance in backend/services/cache_service.py
response_text: |
  Successfully completed T052: Add API response caching for improved performance in backend/services/cache_service.py

  Changes made:
  1. Created a new cache_service.py file with a CacheService class that provides:
     - Thread-safe caching operations
     - Time-to-live (TTL) based expiration
     - Cache key generation based on endpoint and parameters
     - Cache statistics and management functions
  2. Integrated caching with main.py endpoints:
     - /api/retrieve endpoint now caches retrieval results for 5 minutes
     - /api/answer endpoint now caches response results for 10 minutes
     - Both endpoints generate unique cache keys based on request parameters
     - Proper cache hit/miss logging implemented
  3. Updated the tasks.md file to mark T052 as completed

  The caching implementation improves performance by reducing redundant computations and database queries for similar requests, especially for retrieval operations that can be expensive.
outcome: |
  Successfully implemented comprehensive API response caching system with thread-safe operations and configurable TTL. The retrieve and answer endpoints now cache responses appropriately to improve performance.
evaluation: |
  Implementation successfully completed T052 with proper caching functionality. The solution is thread-safe, efficient, and appropriately applied to the most beneficial endpoints. Ready to continue with remaining tasks.
