## Prompt

User initiated /sp.clarify to refine the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" spec. Asked 3 questions:
1. Out-of-Scope content areas. User selected: "Advanced mathematical derivations or heavy theoretical proofs".
2. Learning Outcomes Granularity. User selected: "Both Module and Chapter Level".
3. AI Agent Content Generation Iteration. User selected: "Daily/Per-chapter iteration".

## Response snapshot

The specification for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Project" has been clarified based on user input. Clarifications were applied to 'Out of Scope', 'Learning Outcomes Granularity', and 'AI Agent Content Generation Iteration'. The spec is now ready for the `/sp.plan` phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Specification clarified and updated.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: specs/001-physical-ai-book/spec.md updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan`
- 🧠 Reflection: User input successfully integrated into the specification. The clarification process helped refine key areas of the spec.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
