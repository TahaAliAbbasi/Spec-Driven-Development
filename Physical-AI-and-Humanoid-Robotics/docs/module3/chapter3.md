# Chapter 3: Nav2 Path Planning - Learning Outcomes

This chapter focuses on integrating the ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2) for advanced path planning and autonomous movement, with a specific emphasis on its application to humanoid robots. Upon completion, students will be able to:

*   **Understand Nav2 Architecture**: Explain the core components of Nav2 (e.g., global planner, local planner, costmaps, behavior tree) and their roles in autonomous navigation.
*   **Configure Nav2 for Differential Drive Robots**: Set up and tune Nav2 parameters for common wheeled robots, understanding concepts like odometry, localization, and control.
*   **Adapt Nav2 for Humanoid Movement**: Explore strategies and challenges in adapting Nav2's functionalities for bipedal or multi-limbed humanoid robot navigation, considering balance, gait, and complex kinematics.
*   **Implement Localization Techniques**: Utilize Nav2's localization components (e.g., AMCL, VSLAM integration) to accurately estimate the robot's pose within a known or unknown environment.
*   **Develop Global and Local Path Planners**: Understand the algorithms behind global (e.g., A*, Dijkstra) and local (e.g., DWB, TEB) planners and configure them for specific navigation tasks.
*   **Work with Costmaps**: Configure and interpret static and dynamic costmaps to represent obstacles and navigate safely in complex environments.
*   **Integrate Behavior Trees**: Understand how Nav2 leverages behavior trees for flexible and robust task execution, allowing for reactive behaviors and recovery strategies.
*   **Develop Custom Nav2 Behaviors**: Implement custom Nav2 plugins or behaviors to address unique navigation requirements for humanoid robots, such as stair climbing or door opening.
*   **Troubleshoot Nav2 Navigation Issues**: Diagnose and resolve common problems encountered during Nav2 setup, tuning, and operation, including planning failures and localization drift.

These learning outcomes will guide the content and practical exercises for this chapter.
