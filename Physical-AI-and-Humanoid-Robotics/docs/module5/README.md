# Capstone Project: Humanoid Robot Control - Learning Outcomes

This capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the course, culminating in a complex task where students program a humanoid robot to operate autonomously in a simulated environment. Upon completion, students will be able to:

*   **Synthesize Multi-Disciplinary Knowledge**: Integrate principles from ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity simulation, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to achieve a complex robotic task.
*   **Design Complex Robot Control Systems**: Architect and implement a control system for a humanoid robot that incorporates perception, planning, and action capabilities.
*   **Implement Vision-Language Integration**: Develop a system that interprets natural language commands and translates them into specific robotic actions using LLMs and computer vision.
*   **Integrate Advanced Simulation Techniques**: Utilize photorealistic rendering, synthetic data generation, and high-fidelity physics simulation for robust robot development and testing.
*   **Apply Navigation and Manipulation**: Combine path planning (Nav2), VSLAM, and manipulation algorithms to navigate environments and interact with objects.
*   **Troubleshoot Complex Integration Issues**: Diagnose and resolve problems that arise from integrating multiple complex systems (ROS 2, simulation, AI models).
*   **Evaluate Robot Performance**: Assess the success rate and efficiency of the humanoid robot in completing the assigned task, identifying areas for improvement.
*   **Document and Present Technical Work**: Clearly document the project implementation, challenges faced, and solutions developed, and present the work effectively.

These learning outcomes will guide the project guidelines, rubrics, and evaluation criteria.
