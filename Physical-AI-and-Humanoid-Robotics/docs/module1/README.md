# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Learning Outcomes

This module introduces students to the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the foundational middleware for developing complex robotics applications. Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

## Core Concepts

*   **Understand ROS 2 Architecture**: Grasp the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, and actions, and how they interact within a distributed robotics system.
*   **Grasp `rclpy` Basics**: Comprehend the role of `rclpy` in enabling Python-based ROS 2 development and its importance for AI agent integration.
*   **Understand URDF for Humanoids**: Recognize the purpose of Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) in modeling humanoid robots and their components within the ROS 2 ecosystem.

## Practical Skills

*   **Set up a ROS 2 Environment**: Successfully install and configure a basic ROS 2 development environment (Ubuntu/WSL2 or Dockerized).
*   **Develop Basic ROS 2 Nodes**: Create, compile, and execute simple ROS 2 nodes using `rclpy` for publisher-subscriber patterns.
*   **Implement ROS 2 Communication**: Utilize topics and services for inter-node communication, including message passing and request-response patterns.
*   **Work with URDF**: Load and visualize basic URDF models, understanding the structure of robot descriptions.

## Advanced Understanding

*   **AI Agent Integration**: Articulate how `rclpy` facilitates the integration of advanced AI and machine learning agents with ROS 2 controlled robots.
*   **Simulation Preparation**: Lay the groundwork for simulating humanoid robots by understanding the interaction between ROS 2 control and URDF models.

## Chapters in this Module

*   Chapter 1: Physical AI Fundamentals
*   Chapter 2: ROS 2 Basics (Nodes, Topics, Services)
*   Chapter 3: `rclpy` Integration (Python Agents, URDF for Humanoids)

These learning outcomes will serve as a guide for content creation and student assessment throughout Module 1.
