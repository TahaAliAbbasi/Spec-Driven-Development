# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book covers the fundamentals of robotics, simulation, AI integration, and advanced topics required to build and control humanoid robots.

## Overview

This book is structured into five core modules:

1. **[The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module1)**: Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2, nodes, topics, services, and how to control robots using `rclpy`.
2. **[The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module2)**: Explore physics simulation, high-fidelity rendering, and sensor simulation in virtual environments.
3. **[The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](/docs/module3)**: Understand advanced simulation with NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS components, and Nav2 for humanoid navigation.
4. **[Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models](/docs/module4)**: Implement systems that integrate voice commands, cognitive planning with LLMs, and visual perception.
5. **[Capstone Project: Humanoid Robot Control](/docs/capstone)**: Apply all learned concepts in a comprehensive project.

## System Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of a Physical AI system:

*Note: This diagram shows the integration of ROS 2 for communication, simulation environments for testing, AI components for perception and planning, and the physical or simulated robot platform.*

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1](/docs/module1) to understand the fundamentals of ROS 2, then progress through each module sequentially to build a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

For a quick setup guide, see the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) documentation.
