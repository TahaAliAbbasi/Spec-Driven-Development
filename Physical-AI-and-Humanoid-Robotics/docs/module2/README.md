# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Learning Outcomes

This module introduces students to the concepts and practical application of digital twins in robotics, focusing on Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction. Upon completion, students will be able to:

*   **Understand Digital Twin Concepts**: Explain the role of digital twins in robotics development, testing, and deployment.
*   **Set up Gazebo Environments**: Create, configure, and manipulate simulated environments within Gazebo, including physics properties, models, and sensors.
*   **Simulate Physics & Interactions**: Understand how to simulate realistic physics, gravity, collisions, and joint dynamics for robotic systems in Gazebo.
*   **Integrate Unity for High-Fidelity Rendering**: Describe the advantages of using Unity for realistic visualization and human-robot interaction (HRI) in conjunction with ROS 2.
*   **Implement Basic Unity-ROS 2 Communication**: Develop basic Unity applications that can send and receive data from ROS 2 nodes, enabling control and telemetry of simulated robots.

*   **Simulate Various Sensors**: Configure and utilize simulated sensors such as LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) within Gazebo and/or Unity, and understand how to interpret their data.
*   **Develop Basic Robotics Applications in Simulation**: Create ROS 2 nodes that control simulated robots, process sensor data, and execute simple tasks within a digital twin environment.

These learning outcomes will guide the content and practical exercises for this module.
